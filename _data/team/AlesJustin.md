Aleš Justin is Principal Software Engineer at JBoss by Red
Hat.

He joined JBoss in 2006 to work full time on the Microcontainer project. He currently leads Weld project, a JSR-299/CDI RI, while still contributing to ApplicationServer, Seam, Arquillian and many other JBoss projects.

After realizing what Gavin's next gig was, he was eager to learn more and find a way to contribute. Ceylon's new modular runtime was perfect for this, given his kernel background, hence a prototype quickly emerged.
