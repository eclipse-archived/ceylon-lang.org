John Doe does not work on Ceylon.

He is however the representative of the regular Java user that wish to see a Java-like platform going to the next stage. Je loves his IDE (Eclipse) and does not want to go back to the dark old days of vi or emacs. He loves that the compiler tells him exactly what is wrong with his code without getting in his way.

John works for ACME Corp.
