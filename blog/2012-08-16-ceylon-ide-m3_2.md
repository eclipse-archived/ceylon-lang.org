Gavin, Sjur and Tomáš have been hard at work all summer to deliver a much-improved version
of the Ceylon IDE. This release support exactly the same language constructs and features
the same JVM backend compiler as the M3.1 release, so it's 100% compatible with it. But
while the backend is the same, the UI is much improved, as you can see from the following
change log and screen shots.

## No more dependence on IMP

We recommend removing IMP from your Eclipse installation.

## Ceylon Explorer view

The _Ceylon Explorer View_ presents packages as children of the
containing modules. You should reset your _Ceylon Perspective_ after
updating the IDE on order to get the _Ceylon Explorer_ in place of JDT's
_Package Explorer_.

## Awesome documentation hover

Hover over the name of a Ceylon or Java declaration to see the
gorgeous new hover info. Click in it to browse to other related
declarations.

</p>

## Code popup

`Ctrl-P`, or "Show Code" pops up an information control containing
the code of the referenced declaration. `Ctrl-P` again opens an
editor. Hyperlink navigation from the Code popup is also possible.

</p>

## Hierarchy and Outline popups

As before, `Ctrl-T` and `Ctrl-O` open the popup _Hierarchy_ and
_Outline_ views. These now look a lot prettier, and they are also more
functional. You can filter the contents by typing inside them, and
they remember their bounds. The _Hierarchy View_ is also much better
integrated with Java stuff. `Ctrl-T` inside the open _Hierarchy View_
cycles between _Hierarchy View_, _Supertypes View_, and _Subtypes
View_. These popups have configurable background colors.

</p>

## Auto-addition of needed imports

Refactorings, quick fixes, and autocompletions now add any needed
imports to the top of the source file. In addition, autocompletion
will propose declarations from any imported module, even if the
package is not imported in the current unit.

## New Quick Fixes/Assists

Thanks to Sjur and Tomáš, we now have some new quick fixes and assists:

- convert if/else to then/else, then/else to if/else
- invert if/else
- add type constraint to type parameter

## Clean Imports

_Clean Imports_ now automatically fills in missing imports if
unambiguous, and prompts the user to choose a declaration to import if
ambiguous.

## Terminate Statement

`Ctrl-2` adds any necessary semicolon, closing parens, and closing
braces to terminate the statement at the current line. This feature is
almost magical in how good it is at guessing where the closing
punctuation needs to go.

## Mark occurrences

Occurrence marking is now enabled by default and works like JDT (the
declaration to highlight is the one under the caret).

    <img src="/images/screenshots/m3.2/highlight.png" title="Mark occurences"/>
</p>

## Proposals popups

Completions proposals and quick fix/assist proposal popups now have
syntax highlighting. Typing a "." automatically activates the
completion proposal window. When only one completion proposal is
available, it is automatically applied.

<p class="screenshot">
    <img src="/images/screenshots/m3.2/completion.png" title="Completion popup"/>
</p>

## Select Enclosing/Restore Previous Selection

`Ctrl-shift-up` expands the selection to the containing expression or
program element. `Ctrl-shift-down` takes you back to the previous
selection.

Also `Ctrl-Shift-P` takes you to the matching bracket and _Show In_ now works.

<p class="screenshot">
    <img src="/images/screenshots/m3.2/expand-selection.png" title="Select enclosing selection"/>
</p>

## Outline View

There is now a popup context menu on _Outline View_ nodes. The selected
node now follows the editor caret location.

Tomáš added a toolbar to the _Outline View_, letting you
filter out local declarations and expand/collapse all nodes.

    <img src="/images/screenshots/m3.2/outline-view.png" title="Outline view"/>
</p>

## Open Ceylon Declaration / Open Type

The default keyboard binding for Open Ceylon Declaration is now
`Ctrl-Shift-O` instead of `Ctrl-Shift-C`. This is more ergonomic and
works even inside the Java editor. Inside the Ceylon perspective,
`Ctrl-Shift-T` opens the Open Type dialog, which lets you choose
between Ceylon _and_ Java types in one dialog (a very slow-to-load
dialog, but hey...).

`F3` (Open Selected Declaration) now handles Java declarations.

</p>

## Support for multiple module repositories

The _New Project wizard_ and _Ceylon Preferences page_ now let you configure
multiple module repositories for a project.

    <img src="/images/screenshots/m3.2/new-project.png" title="New project"/>
</p>

## Backend errors

Errors from the compiler backend now show up in the _Problems View_ and
vertical ruler, and compiler progress is visible in the _Progress View_
and status bar. The 80s-style scrolling console is gone.

## Progress

Building the completion proposals and hierarchy for the first time is
now expensive because it involves trawling the whole JDK. 
You get a nice progress bar in the status bar of the main window.

## Parser lifecycle

Code is lexed/parsed synchronously on every keypress, and
lexed/parsed+typechecked synchronously on every keypress when the
completions proposals window is open. This results in much more
responsive syntax highlighting and fixes some wierd behavior in the
completion proposals window. When the completions proposal window is
not open, typechecking still happens in a background job as before.
